# TANG_timer
A 7-minute timer for TANG, based on my TEDxTimer.

Click or touch anywhere on your screen to start the 7-minute countdown. Once the timer is up, the background colour will change to red and it will start counting back up. This way, you always know how much time is left and how much over limit you are. 

To restart the timer, refresh the webpage.

## Custom time
To set a custom countdown time, add `?time=seconds` parameter to the end of the URL, for example: https://zznidar.github.io/TANG_timer/?time=5 will give you a 5-second timer. Similarly, https://zznidar.github.io/TANG_timer/?time=900 will give you a 15-minute timer.
